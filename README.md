##### Two Sum problem
- [Problem description and source](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- Key concepts:
The trick is if we just look at any element in the array, we can figure out what number we should look for to find a match with the target number. If we store this pair, then we can find the result in O(n).
- Solutions:
```ruby
Get an aux memory as HashMap (pairs)
For i = 0 to arr.size
  If (pairs.containsKey(arr[i]))
    Return (pairs.get(arr[i],i)
  Diff = target - arr[i]
  pair.put(diff,i)
return null
```
