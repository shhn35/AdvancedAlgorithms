## Easy Algorithms
##### Two Sum problem
- [Problem description and source](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/)
- Key concepts:
The trick is if we just look at any element in the array, we can figure out what number we should look for to find a match with the target number. If we store this pair, then we can find the result in O(n).
- Solutions:
```ruby
Get an aux memory as HashMap (pairs)
For i = 0 to arr.size
  If (pairs.containsKey(arr[i]))
    Return (pairs.get(arr[i],i)
  Diff = target - arr[i]
  pair.put(diff,i)
return null
```

##### Merge k Sorted List problem
- [Problem description and source](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists)
- Key concepts:
1- Using MinHeap data structure to retrieve the min element among the head of all lists.
2- This approach has the time complexity of O(n log k)
- Solutions:
```ruby
current = head = result = new ListNode
pq = new PriorityQueue
For list in lists
  If list is not null
    pq.offer(list)
If pq.size() == 0
  return null;
while(qp.size() >0 )
  current = pq.poll()
  Result.next = current
  result = result.next
  if(current.next != null)
    pq.offer(current.next)
return head.next
```
